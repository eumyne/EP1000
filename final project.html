                    <h2>Final Project</h2>
                    <p>Since Mr Rodney has expressed his extreme want on having a new table lamp for the soldering station, I have decided to go along his wishes and build one for my final project. (In hopes of getting higher marks >.<) The following are the steps that I took to complete my final project and I have broken it into different parts for ease of reading. <br> <br> 

                    <h4>Research & Design</h4>
                    <b> STEP 1: </b> First of all, I have decided to do some research online through the Instructables website to get some inspiration. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp design (1).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 2: </b> After getting some inspiration through my research, I have settled for design in my brain and drew it out to see the design and see if there are any needed changes. This was my first rough sketch.  <br> <br> 
                    <img src="Images/table lamp design (2).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 3: </b> I have decided that my initial design was not as smart as I thought it was therefore I was contemplating if I should push the box back or if i should just move it to the back. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp design (3).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 4: </b> After comparing the pros and cons, I have decided that pushing the box back was a little dumb as the light would only be shining on the box and not at where the user would want to be. Hence my decision was to bring the box to the back and rotate it such that the buttons are on the side of the dominant hand of most people - the right hand. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp design (4).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 5: </b> I added some lines and circles in a black marker to indicate where I would be making any cuts or engraving.  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp design (5).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 6: </b> After coming up with a new design, I drew it out again. I then decided to do an actual prototype so that I can see if it was practical to use this design.  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp design (6).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>

                    Fusion 360 design file for my final project: <a href = "final project.f3d"> final project design.f3d </a> <br> <br>


                    <h4>Prototype</h4>
                    <b> STEP 1: </b> Firstly, I went around my house in search for some sturdy cardboard and I managed to find some as shown below.  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp prototpye (1).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 2: </b> Next, I started to measure and cut them out to the size that I see fit for the table lamp that I will be making. I also started to cut some holes in them to ensure that the cardboard could fit nicely and therefore create the effect of a lamp.   <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp prototype (2).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 3: </b> I then started to put the parts together and assemble my table lamp prototype.<br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp prototype (3).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 4: </b> After taking a look at my prototype, I felt like it could be improved as there was extra space at the front of the base that was designated for weights. However since I will be making a double layered base, I have decided to move the weights under the box instead of dedicating a space at the front of the base for it. This helps to save space needed on the table to place the table lamp as well as to ensure that the light will be shining wherever the user wants it to be shined at. I then transferred the design to Fusion 360 to have the design ready for laser cutting.  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp prototype (4).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 5: </b> After, I made any changes that I had to make to the design on Fusion 360 and decided to just go ahead and laser cut the design out to see how it would balance using that material. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp prototype (4).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>

                    *Due to time constraints, I have decided to not do a 3D fusion 360 design. Instead I used Fusion 360 to do my designs in 2D, so that I can use the template to do the laser cutting.* <br><br>


                    <h4>Laser Cutting</h4>
                    <b> STEP 1: </b> After saving my design, I converted the sketch into a dxf file and uploaded it into the laser cutting machine.  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp laser cutting (1).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 2: </b> After uploading my design into the laser cutting machine, the machine started to cut out the design that I have uploaded. The material used to cut the draft is cardboard since it is only a draft piece and not the actual final product. Below is the outcome.  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp laser cutting (2).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 3: </b> Next, I started to put the parts together to assemble my draft table lamp. However, I have found out that there we some mismeasurements after trying to put it together. Thus, I would have to make changes to the measurements once again.  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp laser cutting (3).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 4: </b> Since I had to make adjustments to my measurements, I used a ruler to measure the actual lengths and decided if I needed it to be shorter or longer. I made the readjustments on Fusion 360 and saved my design once again as a dxf file and uploaded it to the laser cutting machine and send it for cutting.  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp laser cutting (4).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 5: </b> After uploading my design into the laser cutting machine, the machine started to cut out the design that I have uploaded. The material used is the same as the earlier since it is also a draft piece and not the actual final product. Below is the outcome.  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp laser cutting (5).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 6: </b> I have decided that I needed to do some additional adjustments to the design in fusion 360 as some parts were abit off. Thus, I went on to do the needed adjustments and finalised my deisgn. After finalising the design, I downloaded the design and uploaded it to the laser cutting machine and printed it on plywood this time since it was going to be my final product.  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp laser cutting (6).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 7: </b> The first picture shows how it came out to be and the second shows the table lamp after it has been more or less assembled.  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp laser cutting (7).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>


                    <h4>3D Printing</h4>
                    <b> STEP 1: </b> Firstly, I used Fusion 360 to design the knob for the potentiometer to adjust the brightness of the light. I have decided to create a knob to make it easier for the user to use the potentiometer to adjust the brightness of the table lamp. I have decided to create the knob firstly by recreating the turner on the potentiometer so that I would be able to combine the turner and a cylinder together to make the knob.  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp 3D printing (1).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 2: </b> I used the function combine together with cut to create a new component which would be the knob. I then downloaded the design to upload it to the 3D printing machine.  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp 3D printing (2).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 3: </b> After waiting about 15 mins, the knob is ready and below shows how it looks like. After, I used a plastic hammer to knock the knob into the potentiometer, however since the 3D print of the knob had a plastic rectangle inside, when knocking the knob in the turner, it got stuck sideways instead and I had to reprint the knob without the inner rectangle. Therefore, I used a cylinder to cut into the bigger cylinder.   <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp 3D printing (3).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 4: </b> This is the final look of the knob that I have 3D printed and this is how it looks like.   <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp 3D printing (4).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>

                    <h4>Engineering</h4>
                    <b> STEP 1: </b> I approached Mr Rodney for components that I would need to construct my table lamp which includes things like: LED strips, a nano board, a potentiometer, a big push button, a transistor, and so on.   <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp egineering (1).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 2: </b> Using the LED strips, I soldered 2 LED strips of 4 LEDs each together with a single cord wire. After sticking the LED strips to the top part of the table lamp, I have decided to use a shrinking tube to keep the wires near and tidy    <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp egineering (2).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 3: </b>    <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp egineering (3).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 4: </b> I decided to use a mini breadboard instead of the tiny breadboard that Mr Rodney had provided me along with the nanoboard as I needed to do alot of wiring.   <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp egineering (4).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>


                    <h4>Putting it all together</h4>
                    <b> STEP 1: </b> Firstly, I went around my house in search for some sturdy cardboard and I managed to find some as shown below.  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp together (1).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 2: </b> Next, I started to measure and cut them out to the size that I see fit for the table lamp that I will be making. I also started to cut some holes in them to ensure that the cardboard could fit nicely and therefore create the effect of a lamp.   <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp together (2).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 3: </b> I then started to put the parts together and assemble my table lamp prototype.<br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/table lamp together (3).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 4: </b> After taking a look at my prototype, I felt like it could be improved as there was extra space at the front for the base that was designated for the weights. However since I will be making a double layered base, I have decided to move the weights under the box instead of dedicating a space at the front of the base for it. This helps me to save space needed on the table to place the light as well as to ensure that the light will be shining wherever the user wants it to shine at.  <br> <br>
