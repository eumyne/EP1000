                    <h2>Assignment 1: Prototype</h2>
                    <p>The first prototype that we were tasked to do was to make a phone stand out of cardboard and at the sane time ensure that it is collpasable to make it more conveneient for the user to bring around<br> The following are the steps I took to make the final product. <br> <br>
                    <b>STEP 1:</b> think of a design and sketch the idea out onto a piece of paper 
                    <br> note: sketched on phone first because I had no paper on hand but later transferred design to a paper. <br> <br>

                    <b> STEP 2:</b> search for suitable cardboard to create the prototype 
                    <br> note: ensure that it is not too hard so that it would be easy to cut into and ensure that it is not too soft so that it can support the phone. <br> <br>

                    <h2>Assignment 2: Project Management</h2>
                    <p>The second assignment that I was tasked to do was to think of a design for my final project. I was to choose between 8 possible ideas: Mood Lamp, Information display, Automated tea maker, System to remind people to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds, Contact-less Hand Sanitizer Dispenser, USB controlled volume button, multi-tone doorbell/intruder alert as well as the most useless machine ever project. <br> <br> </p>

                    <h2>Assignment 4: Computer Aided design</h2>
                    <p>The design that we were tasked to do was to make a keyring as well as a fidget spinner.<br> The following are the steps I took to make the final product. <br> <br>
                    <h3>Key Ring</h3>
                    <b>STEP 1:</b> think of a design that you would like to use and sketch it on a piece of paper <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/keyring (1).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 2:</b> create a sketch on fusion360 and sketch a rectangle to start off the whole design. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/keyring (2).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 3: </b> draw a circle with the centrepoint being the midpoint of the top of the rectangle. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/keyring (3).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 4: </b> trim the line at the top of the rectangle and the bottom of the circle to create one part of the keyring. Next, I selected the offset button and selected the the semicircle plus rectangle to offset the figure by negative 2mm to bring it outside instead of inside. <br><br>
                    <img src="Images/keyring (4).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 5: </b> add a circle at the top of the figure and ensure that the bottom of the circle touches the curve of the inner figure and offset the circle by negative 2mm to bring it inside instead of outside. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/keyring (5).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 6: </b> trim off the bottom part of the bigger circle and the curve of the bigger figure where it intersects.  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/keyring (6).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 7: </b> design a heart using circles and lines and I added it to the middle of the keyring that I have designed in the previous steps. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/keyring (7).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 8: </b> fillet the bottom parts of the keyring by 2mm to make it curved and safer for the user. fillet both the inside figure and outside figure to make it look symmetrical. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/keyring (8).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 9: </b> click 'finish sketch' and extrude the figure by 2mm and this is how my key ring looks like!! <br> <br>

                    <h3>Fidget Spinner</h3>
                    <b>STEP 1:</b> think of a design and sketch the idea out onto a piece of paper. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/fidget spinner (1).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 2:</b> create a sketch on Fusion360 and sketch 4 circles to start off. Then create an offset for each circle at 2mm. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/fidget spinner (2).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 3: </b> I used the 'fit point spline' to create the curves of the fidget spinner <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/fidget spinner (3).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 4: </b> using 'line', I connected parts of the fidget spinner that were not connected and lastly I extruded the diagram by 3mm and this is how my fidget spinner looks like like!! <br> <br>

                    <h2>Assignment 5: 3D Printing</h2>
                    <p>The fifth assignment that I was tasked to do was to create a chess peice using Fusion360. The head of the chess piece was to be extruded and the base, revolution. The following were the steps I took to get my finished product <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 1: </b> I searched online for an outline of the chess piece and downloaded it <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (1).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 2: </b> I inserted the outline of the downloaded chess piece in the form of a canvas <br> <br> 
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (2).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 3: </b> After entering sketch mode, I used the 'line' function to create a rough outline of the chess piece. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (3).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 4: </b> After measuring the height and width of the chess piece to ensure that it is of the appropriate size, I clicked 'finish sketch' and continued by extruding the head piece of the chess piece in this case, I used 3mm. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (9).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 5: </b> Next, I created an outline for half of the base piece and ensured that it was more or less centralised, after I exited the sketch mode. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (4).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 6: </b> After exiting sketch mode, I then used revolution on the base piece to suit the type 'full'. After, I saved the project as an STL file  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (5).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 7: </b> I opened Cura and selected Ultimaker 2+ as the 3D printer with PLA filament. I then uploaded the chess piece into Cura and tuned the settings to ensure that I could print the chess piece within 45 minutes. In my case it prompted me that it would only take about 16 minutes as my chess piece was more mini-sized. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (6).jpg" width=400px height = 300px alt> <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 8: </b> I added the gcode file into the sd card of the ultimaker 2+ to upload my design into the 3D printing machine. After selecting my design, I sent it for printing and began the waiting process. <br> <br>

                    <h2>Assignment 6: Computer Controlled Cutting</h2>
                    <p>The sixth assignment that I was tasked to do was to create a wooden box using Fusion360. The following were the steps I took to get my finished product. <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 1: </b> First, I assigned parameters for the dimensions of the box. This is so that it would be easier to adjust the size of the box if the need arises. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/small box (1).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 2: </b> Next, I started by sketching a rectangle and adjusting it according to the parameters from the previous step. <br> <br> 
                    <img src="Images/small box (2).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 3: </b> Next, I added lines at the side of the rectangle to form the fingers and thickness of the box. I also adjusted the distances to fit what I have stated in the parameters from the first step. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/small box (3).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 4: </b> Next, I exrtuded the sketch that I have just made in the previous step, to a thickness of 3mm. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/small box (4).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
