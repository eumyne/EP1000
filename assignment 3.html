                    <h2>3D Printing</h2>
                    <p>The fifth assignment that I was tasked to do was to create a chess peice using Fusion360. The head of the chess piece was to be extruded and the base, revolution. The following were the steps I took to get my finished product <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 1: </b> I searched online for an outline of the chess piece and downloaded it <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (1).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 2: </b> I inserted the outline of the downloaded chess piece in the form of a canvas <br> <br> 
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (2).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 3: </b> After entering sketch mode, I used the 'line' function to create a rough outline of the chess piece. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (3).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 4: </b> After measuring the height and width of the chess piece to ensure that it is of the appropriate size, I clicked 'finish sketch' and continued by extruding the head piece of the chess piece in this case, I used 3mm. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (9).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 5: </b> Next, I created an outline for half of the base piece and ensured that it was more or less centralised, after I exited the sketch mode. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (4).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 6: </b> After exiting sketch mode, I then used revolution on the base piece to suit the type 'full'. After, I saved the project as an STL file  <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (5).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 7: </b> I opened Cura and selected Ultimaker 2+ as the 3D printer with PLA filament. I then uploaded the chess piece into Cura and tuned the settings to ensure that I could print the chess piece within 45 minutes. In my case it prompted me that it would only take about 16 minutes as my chess piece was more mini-sized. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (6).jpg" width=400px height = 300px alt> <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 8: </b> I added the gcode file into the sd card of the ultimaker 2+ to upload my design into the 3D printing machine. After selecting my design, I sent it for printing and began the waiting process. <br> <br>
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (7-3).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> 
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (7-2).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 9: </b> After waiting about 20 minutes, my chess piece was ready to be removed and I had my very own chess piece made by me! <br> <br>

                    <img src="Images/chess piece (7).jpg" width=180px height = 300px alt> 
                    <img src="Images/chess piece (8).jpg" width=400px height = 300px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> HERO SHOT: </b> This is how it looks like after removing the supports. <br> <br>
